            <h2>
                Getting the NIBObee library to work on Linux
            </h2>
            <p>
                I simply wrote this tutorial, because I didn't find any NIBObee
                library installation tutorial for Linux. The system I am using
                here is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr. If you use Debian, you
                should get along well with this tutorial. If you have bought a
                NIBObee robot, you most likely got it with a CD. The only
                relevant folder you will need for this is “linux”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open the root directory of the CD-ROM and look at the content.
                You will see 5 tar archives containing 4 programs and the
                NIBObee library.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you have at least 2 options:<br>
                - Install the 4 programs
                  <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/">avrdude</a>,
                  <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/">avr-libc</a>,
                  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">binutils</a>
                  and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">gcc</a> from
                  the tar archives by unpacking and compiling them<br>
                - Download and installation of the programs with package
                  management software like
                  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/apt-get">apt-get</a>,
                  <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/">pacman</a> or
                  <a href="http://yum.baseurl.org/">yum</a><br><br>

                Out of comfortability I recommend using the second option. So
                type:
            </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        sudo apt-get install avrdude avr-libc binutils gcc
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After you have done that, you have still some work to do.
                    First, we need to make a project directory for our NIBObee
                    projects.<br>
                    Here we will create this folder on the desktop with:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        mkdir ~/Desktop/nibobee-projects
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Assuming you are using the CD, type the following commands
                    to change into the CD-ROM directory and then copy the
                    “nibobeelib” tar file to your newly created directory:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        cd /media/$USER/NIBObee/linux/<br>
                        cp nibobeelib-20110603.tgz ~/Desktop/nibobee-projects/
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now, we can go back into the projects folder and extract
                    the .tgz archive:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        cd ~/Desktop/nibobee-projects<br>
                        tar xvf $(ls | grep nibobeelib)
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We are also stuck at another problem without even realizing
                    it. The makers of the CD packaged the include directory for
                    Linux differently as they did for Windows. The include
                    directory is in fact there! But it is located in the src
                    folder and called nibobee instead of include. But don't
                    worry, this problem will get solved in a few moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you now check the directory, you will find the folders
                    doc, hex, lib and src. And the .tgz file.
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            doc contains documentation on the various functions
                            of the NIBObee library. If you want to study the
                            NIBObee library in more detail, you should
                            definitely check it out!<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            hex contains interesting precompiled .hex files
                            which you can directly transfer to your robot<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            lib contains the library files<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            src contains the source code, include files,
                            tutorial programs and much more
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    This is how I installed the NIBObee library:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        sudo mkdir /opt/nibobeelib/<br>
                        sudo mv doc hex lib src /opt/nibobeelib/
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now you have all files you need, nicely organized in the
                    /opt/ folder of your Linux distribution.<br>
                    Let's copy over a program from the /opt/nibobeelib/ folder
                    and change into it:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        cp -r /opt/nibobeelib/src/tutorial/program1 .<br>
                        cd program1
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Try to compile the program by typing
                    <code class="command">make</code> .<br> But, what just
                    happened? The console now shows us:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">

                </div>
                <p>
                    This is completely normal and I will now explain what just
                    happened. The Makefile in this folder uses relative paths
                    instead of absolute paths. As you can see, the problem
                    occurs with the relative paths, seen here as dots:
                    <span>../../</span><br>

                    Thus, I have modified the Makefile to take care of that
                    problem. Download it
                    <a href="https://gist.github.com/christianheinrichs/a8cbbeb299c7f3a79b6a/download">
                        here
                    </a> and replace the default Makefile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at the diff file, you can see the changes:

                <p>
                    I changed the relative paths so that they point to our
                    /opt/nibobeelib/ directory. Why? This way we can compile
                    the C source code from any folder location without problems.
                    Furthermore, I modified the “clean” function to also delete
                    .xhex files, as the default Makefile doesn't do that. By
                    now, you should have replaced the original Makefile with
                    the modified version.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Alright, before we compile the program1.c program, we have
                    to first transfer a .hex file which calibrates the odometry
                    sensors of the robot.<br>
                    First make a new project directory called “calibration”:

                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        mkdir ~/Desktop/nibobee-projects/calibration/
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Copy the hex file from the NIBObee library like so:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        cp /opt/nibobeelib/hex/calibration.hex ../calibration
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now, download the script
                    <a href="https://gist.github.com/christianheinrichs/ab750c916ef11d42d5de/download">
                        here
                    </a> and put it into the “calibration” folder or copy and
                    paste the following code into a file called calibrate.sh,
                    <br>

                    which should be saved in the just recently mentioned folder
                    “calibration”:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        #!/bin/bash<br><br>

                        HFUSE=0xd1<br>
                        LFUSE=0xef<br>
                        PROGRAMMER=usbasp<br>
                        TARGET=calibration<br><br>

                        printf '\E[31m'"\033[1mFlashing calibration program in 3 seconds\n\033[0m"<br>
                        sleep 3<br><br>

                        sudo avrdude -c $PROGRAMMER -p m16 -B 10 -U lfuse:w:$LFUSE:m -U hfuse:w:$HFUSE:m<br>
                        sudo avrdude -c $PROGRAMMER -p m16 -B 2 -U flash:w:$TARGET.hex
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    For this script, I just took the values and commands of the
                    default Makefile and adapted them to a .hex file, because
                    nothing has to be compiled. Okay, flip on the power switch
                    of your NIBObee and connect it via USB to your computer or
                    laptop, then go into the “calibration” directory and
                    transfer the calibration file to the robot with the
                    following 3 commands:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        cd ~/Desktop/nibobee-projects/calibration<br>
                        chmod +x calibrate.sh<br>
                        ./calibrate.sh
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    You will see the green programming LED (LED4) flashing once
                    and a bunch of messages in your console. The script is
                    flashing the fuses HFUSE AND LFUSE and, last but not least,
                    the FLASH memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If everything went fine, the NIBObee is now in calibration
                    mode and you have to calibrate it. Find a white surface
                    and a black surface, ideally a piece of white paper and a
                    piece of black paper. Now place the robot on a white
                    surface and push back the left feeler. You will see the the
                    yellow LEDs blink 5 times. Place the robot on a black
                    surface now and push back the right feeler. You will see
                    the red LEDs blink 5 times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To save the calibrated values, push both feelers forward
                    simultaneously and all 4 LEDs blink 5 times. The NIBObee
                    should now have saved the calibration values into its
                    EEPROM memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You almost completed this tutorial. We are now going to
                    compile the first program.<br>
                    Go into the program1 folder like this:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        cd ~/Desktop/nibobee-projects/program1/
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Then type <code class="command">make</code> to compile the
                    code and transfer the .hex file with:
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    <code>
                        sudo make avrdude
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    When it's finished you should see the red LED1 blinking
                    constantly in the same pattern. Congratulations, you
                    successfully installed the NIBObee library on Linux,
                    learned a little bit about Makefile debugging, calibrated
                    your NIBObee robot, compiled and transferred your first
                    program to the robot!
                <p>
                    Thanks to nicai-systems for creating the NIBObee robot and
                    writing such good tutorials!
                </p>
