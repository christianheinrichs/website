        Protectors and providers
      </h2>
      <p>
      <p>
        If you have a good relationship with your parents (and I assume that
        most of you do), it is important to remember that without them, you
        wouldn't exist. Think about what they have sacrificed, what possible
        dreams and hopes they might have given up for your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you think of a woman taking care of her child, it is amazing what
        kind of strong, protective instincts a mother develops. A mother carries
        life for multiple months and does everything in her power to protect it.
        It simply is in her nature. Nurturing it, caring for the child, making
        the embryonic organism feel safe until it is ready to enter what we know
        as life. What was previously mentioned can be observed in most, if not
        all species, including humans. These maternal instincts are statically
        encoded in female specimens of the human race, if no genetic defect
        occurred in the mother herself and persist until the end of the mother's
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us not forget that the male counterpart also plays a significant
        role in the process of parenthood. While the father certainly has no
        ability to develop so called maternal instincts, he still takes on the
        role of a protector. Yet in a different way. In that context, the task
        of a father is mostly to protect his own flesh and blood from real,
        physical threats, i.e. enemies (usually defined by a natural pecking
        order, also known as food chain) and environmental dangers such as harsh
        weather conditions or even natural catastrophes by any means possible.
        Aside from that, human fathers as well as fathers in nonhuman form are,
        naturally seen, providers. What in modern society is mostly maintaining
        a job so you can feed your family, is really not that different from
        this specific practice in times of precivilization. Instead of “having a
        job” and maintaining it, your “job” back then was very likely to build
        primitive weapons, hunting tools, fishing rods etc. out of resources
        freely available in nature such as wood and rock, so that you could go
        out and hunt, fish, or, in the absence of animals (especially in the
        winter), forage the fields, forests and other natural habitats for
        berries, mushrooms, edible plants and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combine all of this and you get a natural dynamic making possible the
        circle of life.
