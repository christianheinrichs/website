        Replacing Ubuntu with Debian
      </h2>
      <p>
        My interest in Linux evolved in the year 2013 and
        <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> was the distribution of my
        choice then, as it has been recommended multiple times to be a good
        beginner distro. I have not been disappointed. Ubuntu is indeed one of
        the easiest, if not, the easiest Linux distribution for people who are
        just getting into Linux. However, as time has passed, I grew bored with
        the Unity desktop environment and using the same tools over and over. I
        had the feeling that I was not getting the actual Debian experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew that Ubuntu is based on
        <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, but was not ready yet to
        use it due to concerns that it might still be too difficult for me to
        setup and configure. Then, after approximately 1 year, I was finally fed
        up and made the switch. In this time I have used Lubuntu 13.10 and
        Ubuntu 11.04 on one computer and mainly Ubuntu 12.04 as well as Ubuntu
        14.04 on a laptop. About 1 week ago, I decided that I wanted to replace
        Ubuntu with Debian, after having tested a live CD of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I’ve downloaded number 1 of the DVD ISO file, which contains the
        <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> desktop environment in the
        default install. Additionally to that, you can install 3 other desktop
        environments from this image. Precisely,
        <a href="https://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>,
        <a href="https://lxde.org/">LXDE</a> and
        <a href="https://xfce.org/">XFCE</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I am using Debian for a while, I must say, that having a pure
        Debian system is quite refreshing. Note however, that one important part
        of the Debian philosophy is depending on using stable and rigorously
        tested software instead of using the latest software. Don’t expect a
        default stable Debian install to have the latest programs installed.
        That’s not what it’s about. Nonetheless, you can of course install the
        newest software by downloading the source packages and compiling them.
        You can also use the ‘testing’ and ‘unstable’ repositories, instead of
        using the ‘stable’ ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, I think that Debian as well as Ubuntu are great
        beginner distributions. Ubuntu being the simpler one. It depends
        entirely on you and your experience with computers in general, so choose
        wisely.
