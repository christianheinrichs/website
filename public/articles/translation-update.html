      <h2>
        Translation update
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a short text to let you know the current status of my website’s
        translation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in spring 2019, which must have been at around April and May, I
        decided to translate my website into the Russian language. Since my
        knowledge of it is not that good, a native Russian speaker will notice
        obvious flaws and errors. The reason I decided to publish a translation
        anyway, is because the Russian language is part of who I am and I see no
        reason to hide the fact that I am of partially Slavic descent. I grew up
        in Germany and therefore consider the German language my native
        tongue and that’s also the reason you are seeing a German translation on
        this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        All that being said however, my motivation in doing this kind of task is
        at the moment very low, so consider the Russian translation on hold, and
        the German translation being updated very infrequently, if at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you.
